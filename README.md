Press play. Play. Unlock. Seek. Play. Unlock. Seek. It's the routine I had followed when learning to play songs on the guitar. I'd press play in the Spotify app, practice the segment, unlock my phone, and seek back to the beginning. It's a ten second process, that when compounded over the course of learning an entire song, adds up to an unbearable amount of time. 

Some things are best left to a physical interface: enter SeattleLofts 1. Inspired by the digital track bar that has become so ingrained in media players everywhere, the SeattleLofts 1 takes this familiar pattern and makes it analog. It is a Spotify console - one that displays what's currently playing, mechanically progresses the track bar, and enables someone to skip around in a song without missing a beat.

# The Making Of

The SeattleLofts 1 is made of walnut.

The SeattleLofts 1 is supported by a RaspberryPi Zero W, providing a minimal profile with wifi support. I programmed in Java and leveraged the [Pi4J library](http://pi4j.com) for input/output. Pictured above is the early stages experimenting with pinging the Spotify web api. The final ping-rate is 300ms to achieve minimal latency while not overburdening the Spotify endpoint.

The original plan was to use a CNC machine to route out the inside. I had obsessed over the interior design, making sure all of the components would fit. After getting a crazy quote for the work, I decided to do it by hand. I built the enclosure at the *Capitol Hill Tool Library* in Seattle WA. A plunge router was used for the exterior openings, and a drill press for the interior.

I had designed and 3D printed three knobs for the track bar. Two entirely of plastic with different diameters, the third a combination of plastic and steel. Plastic was used for its low minimal thickness. The parts were printed through *[Shapeways](http://shapeways.com)*.
