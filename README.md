Press play. Play. Unlock. Seek. Play. Unlock. Seek. It's the routine I had followed when learning to play songs on the guitar. I'd press play in the Spotify app, play the segment on my guitar, unlock my phone, and seek back to the beginning. It's a ten second process, that when compounded over the course of learning an entire song, added up to an unbearable amount of time. 

Some things are best left to a physical interface: enter SeattleLofts 1. Inspired by the digital track bar that has become so ingrained in media players everywhere, the SeattleLofts 1 takes this familiar digital pattern and makes it analog. It is a Spotify console - one that displays what's currently playing, automatically progresses the track bar, and enables someone to  skip around in a song without missing a beat.
