Press play. Play. Unlock. Seek. Play. Unlock. Seek. It's the routine I had followed when learning to play songs on the guitar. I'd press play in the Spotify app, practice the segment, unlock my phone, and seek back to the beginning. It's a ten second process, that when compounded over the course of learning an entire song, adds up to an unbearable amount of time. 

Some things are best left to a physical interface: enter SeattleLofts 1. Inspired by the digital track bar that has become so ingrained in media players everywhere, the SeattleLofts 1 takes this familiar pattern and turns it analog. It is a Spotify console - one that displays what's currently playing, mechanically progresses the track bar, and enables someone to skip around in a song without missing a beat.

# The Making Of

There were a ton of resources I took advantage of to get this thing built. The SeattleLofts 1 is made of walnut purchased at *[Crosscut Hardwoods](http://www.crosscutseattle.com)*, and was handmade at the *[Capitol Hill Tool Library](https://sustainablecapitolhill.org/tool-library/)* in Seattle WA. The hardware is supported by a *[RaspberryPi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org)*, is programmed in Java, and leverages the *[Pi4J library](http://pi4j.com)*. Three track bar knobs were designed in *[Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com)*, and 3D printed at *[Shapeways](http://shapeways.com)*. Components (RaspberryPi, motorized slide potentiometer, and 2x16 black and white LCD) were purchased at *[Sparkfun Elecronics](https://www.sparkfun.com)*.
